This project leverages machine learning techniques to perform sentiment analysis on Twitter data. The goal is to classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral, helping organizations, researchers, and individuals gain valuable insights into public sentiment on various topics. 
This repository provides an end-to-end solution, including data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.

Features:
1).Data Preprocessing: Cleans and processes raw tweet data, including text normalization, tokenization, and stopword removal.
2).Machine Learning Models: Implements algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
3).Sentiment Classification: Categorizes tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.
4).Visualization: Generates insightful visualizations to understand sentiment distributions.
5).Evaluation Metrics: Measures performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Project Structure:
1).data/: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the models.
2).notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for the step-by-step implementation of sentiment analysis.
3).scripts/: Python scripts for preprocessing, training, and evaluating models.
4).results/: Includes visualizations and evaluation reports.

Methodology:
1).Data Collection: Gathered tweets using APIs or publicly available datasets.
2).Preprocessing: Cleaned text data by removing URLs, mentions, and special characters.
3).Model Development: Trained and compared multiple models to identify the best-performing one.
4).Evaluation: Assessed model performance using classification metrics and confusion matrices.

Results:
1).Accuracy: The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of 88% in sentiment classification.
2).Insights: Sentiment distribution visualizations provide an overview of public opinion on various topics.
